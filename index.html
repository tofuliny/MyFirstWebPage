                <p>I've always been quite interested in programming, but I've never
                   done it. I had my first programming experience in elementary school.
                    Here we were taught the basics of HTTP as well as simple programming
                     of 2d games in Gamemaker.
                </p>

                <p>As I already enjoyed it a lot so I thought why not try it
                    and not learn to program. Otherwise, I would like to make
                     a living from it.
                </p>

                <h3>A logic gate:</h3>
                <p class="smaller">It is an idealized or physical device implementing
                     a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation on
                      one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.</p>

                <h3>ASCII code</h3>
                <p class="smaller">It stands for American Standard Code for Information
                     Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, so it is the
                      numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or
                       an action of some sort.</p> 
                
                <h3>Random-acces memory</h3>
                <p class="smaller">It is a form of computer data storage which stores
                     frequently used program instructions to increase the general speed
                      of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or
                       written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the
                        physical location of data inside the memory.</p>

                <h3>Programming language</h3>
                <p class="smaller">A formal language that specifies a set of instructions
                     that can be used to produce various kinds of output. They generally
                      consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create
                       programs that implement specific algorithms.</p>

                <h3>DNS-Domain Name System</h3>
                <p class="smaller">A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers,
                     services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network.
                      It associates various information with domain names assigned to each
                       of the participating entities.</p>

                <h3>HTTP-Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h3>
                <p class="smaller">An application protocol for distributed, collaborative,
                     and hypermedia information systems. It is the foundation of data communication
                      for the World Wide Web. It is the standard protocol to exchange or
                       transfer hypertext.</p>
